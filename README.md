# Yet 1 More Chat System


Yup, thats right, _just one more chat system_ that the internet doesn't really need! Then why make such a thing? well the truth is I like making chats, they are a system that can be as simple or complex as you want, and this project will be used to showcase my programming skills. Along this, I will be using this project to try new things I feel that could be cooked into a chat system.
